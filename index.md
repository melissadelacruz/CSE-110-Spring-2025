# CSE 110 Spring 2025 Lab 1

## Part 1: ***Installing Visual Studio Code and Extensions***

I was able to install the extensions for all that was recommended such as:

- **Draw.io Integration** – useful for creating diagrams such as flowcharts and class diagrams  
- **Live Share** – good for real-time collaboration and debugging with teammates  
- **Markdown All In One** – makes writing and viewing markdown files easier  
- **CodeStream** – helpful for improving team communication and connecting code changes with comments or issues

## Part 2: ***(Re)Familiarizing Ourselves with Git***

For this part of the lab, I used Git to access and modify my repository on GitHub. Below is the process I followed using both the **Command Line** and **VS Code Source Control UI**.

### Command Line Steps

1. Created a public GitHub repository with a `README.md` file.
2. **Cloned** the repository to my local machine
3. **CD** into repo, create **new branch**, and **checkout** into that branch. I named mine `new-branch`.
4. **Add** the new file to git
5. **Commit** the files with the commit message "update readme file"
6. **Push** the commit to the remote branch

Here are screenshots of each step performed in order:
